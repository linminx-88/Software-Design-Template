# Software-Design-Template
design template for Draw It or Lose It game

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The client for this design template was The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room requested a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.
What I did well for this assignment was the research for each operating platform. I felt that there was much information to be incorpporated in the design document regarding the differences and similarites in the design document.
Working through the design document, it wad helpful to see the end goal of the program when working through the code. It enables the code to be concise and accurate to the user's needs.
If I were to revise a part of the design document I would revise the recommendations on the operating systems and its architecture because I felt I did not fully understand the architecture.
I interpreted the user's needs by referencing other popular games and which operating systems that they were available for and seeing the similiarity and differences. It is iportant to consider the user's needs because he/she will be the person using the program and are the audience. The program should be functional to their needs.
I approached designing the software by researching different operating systems and their design architecture. I researched which tools and IDEs were available and which I felt confident in using. In the future I would research these tools again to prepare myself.
